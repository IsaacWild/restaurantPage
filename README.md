# restaurantPage

This is my restaurant Page project for the Odin Project course that I modelled for a real-world restaurant.

## Description

This was made as a part of my Odin Project restaurant page and I modelled it after a real-world restaurant near my hometown, I will be reaching out to them to see if they are interested in procuring the site and gain valuable feedback and real world use of creating a commertial site for a client.

Within the project I was tasked with using webpack, this is my 1st project using it and I hope to expand my knowledge and use of the service in more of my projects going forward, I also had to use DOM manipulation to create each page and dynamically render each page and all the content.

I found it a fun project that allowed me to learn new skills such as webpack and also I was able to implement my first use of an iframe tag for the google maps integration, I chose to work from a mobile-first design using the Chrome Dev tools while previewing my page live as I built it in a mobile view, I then styled the page as it grew to help ensure a useable design and layout as screen sizes increased. 

I am proud of my first webpack project but to return to this in the future I would like to add more style control with the use of media queries to set separate screen size layouts.
